        <h1>Story Of The Door</h1>
        <p>Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/countenance">countenance</a> that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life.</p>
        <p>He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theater, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/approved">approved</a> tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.</p>
        <h2>Search For Mr. Hyde</h2>
        <p>He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theater, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/approved">approved</a> tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.</p>
        <h3>Dr. Jekyll Was Quite At Ease</h3>
        <p>"I incline to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cain">Cain's heresy</a>," he used to say quaintly: "I let my brother go to the devil in his own way." In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.</p>
        <h4>The Carew Murder Case</h4>
        <p>No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/undemonstrative" title="wiktionary:undemonstrative">undemonstrative</a> at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/catholicity">catholicity</a> of good-nature.</p>
        <h5>Incident Of The Letter</h5>
        <p>It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer's way.</p>
        <h6>Remarkable Incident Of Dr. Lanyon</h6>
        <p>His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object.</p>
